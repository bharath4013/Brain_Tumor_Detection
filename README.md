# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Brain tumor is one of the most rigorous diseases in the medical science. An effective and efficient analysis is always a key concern for the radiologist in
the premature phase of tumor growth. Histological grading, based on a stereotactic biopsy test, is the gold standard and the convention for 
detecting the grade of a brain tumor. The biopsy procedure requires the neurosurgeon to drill a small hole into the skull from which the tissue is collected.
There are many risk factors involving the biopsy test, including bleeding from the tumor and brain causing infection, seizures, severe migraine, stroke, 
coma and even death. But the main concern with the stereotactic biopsy is that it is not 100% accurate which may result in a serious diagnostic error followed
by a wrong clinical management of the disease. 

Tumor biopsy being challenging for brain tumor patients, non-invasive imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging have been extensively employed in
diagnosing brain tumors. Therefore, development of systems for the detection and prediction of the grade of tumors based on MRI data has become necessary. But
at first sight of the imaging modality like in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the proper visualization of the tumor cells and its differentiation with its nearby
soft tissues is somewhat difficult task which may be due to the presence of low illumination in imaging modalities or its large presence of data or several
complexity and variance of tumors-like unstructured shape, viable size and unpredictable locations of the tumor.
